# Horiseon Landing Page Code Refactoring

This is the repo for the Horiseon landingpage

## Intro

The scope for this project was to take the existing code for the Horiseon and make it more accessible and to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.

### This is what has been done to improve the codebase

- Use semantic HTML selectors
- Add comments to HTML and CSS to explain what the code does
- Make sure elements follow a logical structure
- Added accessible alt attributes to images
- Checked that all heading attributes are in the right order
- Checked that all links function properly
- CSS selectors updated and consoilidated so file does not use multiple class selctors for the same CSS styles
- Deployed the application at live URL
